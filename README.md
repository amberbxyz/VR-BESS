# VR-BESS Bertec Digital Acquire Data Processor

[This script](process.py) was created to process large sets of CSV files generated by [Digital Acquire 4](https://www.bertec.com/s/Digital-Acquire-4.pdf) from Bertec Corporation for use in a study of virtual reality to improve the sensitivity of the balance error scoring system in adolescence  with a history of concussion.

## Installation

## Usage

To process the data contained in the CSV files in the `force_plate_data` folder, run `process.py`:

```sh
python3 process.py
```

It may take a few minutes to run depending on how much data needs to be processed. A file named `processed_data.csv` will be created.
